\begin{rSection}{Work Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Hewlett Packard Enterprise(HPE)}{\em June 2021 - Present}{\textbf{Software Engineer - dHCI/HCI Storage Manager, Greenlake Cloud Services}}{San Jose, California}{}
\item Worked in two scrum teams to handle urgent escalation tickets and QA-reported release tickets in agile cycles. Addressed the underlying issues through making critical fixes in the codebase. 
\item Added multi-cluster support for on-prem and hybrid dHCI solutions. Enabled new and more scalable deployment options with 200+ nodes. 
\item Designed and built new features from scratch for 2 cloud native Go-based microservices within HPE Greenlake Cloud Services. 


\end{rSubsection}
\begin{rSubsection}{Hewlett Packard Enterprise(HPE)}{\em January 2021 - May 2021}{\textbf{Software Engineering Co-op - Disaggregated Hyperconverged Infrastructure(dHCI)}}{Remote}{}
\item Worked with respective code owners to refactor code in 6 repositories to bring up the language level to Java 11 in order to improve performance and to receive future security updates.
\item Implemented package level custom stress tests and persistence tests and performed heap memory analysis to verify performance. In heavy workflows like VM migration, performance was improved up to 10\%.




\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Hewlett Packard Enterprise(HPE)}{\em May 2020 - August 2020}{\textbf{Software Engineering Intern - Disaggregated Hyperconverged Infrastructure(dHCI)}}{Remote}{}
\item Leveraged VMware Automation API to achieve vCenter minor update automation for HPE Nimble dHCI Intelligent 1-Click Updates feature. 
\item Deployed Swagger Codegen to generate client SDKs at runtime in order to further automate update-related VMware API consumption.
\item Reduced update workflow time by 16.7\% for each server within the dHCI environment. Project branch was merged with the release branch at the end of internship and shipped in the next release vehicle.

\begin{rSubsection}{Web application demonstrating one to two bit oblivious transfer theorem.}{\em February 2019 - May 2019}{\textbf{GitHub: github.com/dwpannn/oblivious-theorem}}{}
\item A website based on Ruby on Rails to solve the issue that sometimes people feel awkward when confessing or talking to others' about personal feelings. Namely, this prototype solves the problem of not knowing whether your crush likes you or not. The logic behind the operation is one to two bit oblivious transfer theorem.

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSubsection}{Java application based on refined Huffman coding algorithm}{\em March 2019}{\textbf{GitHub: github.com/dwpannn/huffmanCoding}}{}
\item An application uses truncated tree structure to shorten the length of the binary string returned. Increased encoding efficiency over traditional tree structure by over 25\%.
